collection of exercises I attempted to learn python

Will try to remember to update this page with details

- Space Launch:

  A simple game inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo47qPvs3HQ
  Goal is to guess the right value to launch off the alien planet. Values are random.
  Basically - guess higher or lower, hot or cold. 

- Divisible By 3or5 Sum:

  Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CgafaxnQ9A
  Scripts goes through every number between 0 and your chosen limit, grabs all the ones that are divisible by 3 or 5 and then sums up all the values.
  I added a few things, such as start and end times, progress bar, readable format, etc
